### **What is BEP-1155?** <a href="#2b64" id="2b64"></a>

BEP-1155 is the multi-token standard that combines the fungibility of BEP-20 and the non-fungibility of BEP-721 in one contract, which finds a middle ground of fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient (yes, cheaper gas!).

With a single BEP-1155 contract, users can deploy a token economy with fungible (tokens) and non-fungible (NFTs). Crypto projects like Axie Infinity have adopted similar models incorporating BEP1155 and multi-asset / token smart contracts into their gaming tokenomics.

BEP1155 in the X World Games will be an NFT-like asset that can be traded across **all NFT marketplaces**, like Opensea, Looksrare, and our official X Marketplace.
