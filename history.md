# History

In 2017, before X World Games entered the blockchain, it had developed a super popular Japanese action mobile game, "Belle Battle Musou.", which has a user base of 300,000. In addition, the X World Games team had developed nearly a hundred online mini-games and has rich experience in game production in the mobile game industry.

As the founder of X World Games, Fernando has more than a decade of investment experience and a keen sense of market trends. In his early years, he had invested in many blockchain and mobile game projects. Therefore, he slowly has an idea to merge all these interesting elements, games, blockchain, DeFi, Japanese anime, NFT, metaverse, etc., all together to create a blockchain game ecosystem and metaverse.

In 2019, X World Games started the journey of blockchain games, advanced with the Japanese ACG style, launched its first NFT TCG game project - Dream Card, and completed its Genesis Sale in 2021.

During the period, X World Games has signed the well-known Japanese IP "Tenchi Muyo!", an OVA animation released in 1992 and a childhood memory of most post-80s generation people. In addition, cooperation and negotiation with the famous fighting arcade game "KOF, The King of Fighters'' are also underway. In the future, collaboration with European and American IP will continue to rise, and the game ecosystem of X World Games will keep going and expanding.
