Once you’ve installed BlueStacks 5, there’s still one more step you need to do before playing: linking your Google account. This is necessary for accessing important services such as the Play Store, which is from where you’ll be downloading most, if not all, your games.

Linking a Google account is very simple, and is one of the first things you’ll do after installing BlueStacks since you’ll be prompted to do so by the emulator. In this text screen, you just need to input your Google user and password, and you’ll be ready to start installing games on BlueStacks.

**Note:** If for any reason you didn’t get the initial Google setup screen upon launching BlueStacks, you can still add your account via the Android settings menu on the home screen, in the “Accounts” sub menu. Alternatively, if you try to access the Play Store, you’ll also be prompted to link an account if you haven’t done so already.
