## What is Dream Card V2 (2.0)?

Dream Card V2 is a multi-player RPG game built with Unity and features in PvE mode.&#x20;

Dream Card V2 is NOT a write-over of Dream Card V1 (1.0). Both versions would be available and running simultaneously- coherent and parallel. Any and all game assert is intact and completely inter-transferable between the two versions.
