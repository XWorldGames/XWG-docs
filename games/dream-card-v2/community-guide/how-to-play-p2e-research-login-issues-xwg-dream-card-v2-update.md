![](../../../.gitbook/assets/1MROonVDRQzLrbbNSV\_6UAQ.jpeg)

All basics about this topic you find in my first article:\
[P2E Research: Login Issues XWG Dream Card V2 (Troubleshooting)](https://medium.com/@cap1osmokaess/p2e-research-login-issues-xwg-dream-card-v2-9bba26139820)

In the following I will tell you a 100% solution and I will describe the common login troubleshooting again because there are some changes since the last update.

### The solution (if you have the resources) — Another phone or tablet <a href="#f6c4" id="f6c4"></a>

The solution (if you have the resources) — Another phone or tablet

I suggest to go this way if you have another device that can rund Dream Card V2.

In my first article I wrote a lot about the issue and what could cause it. And using a second device eliminates all these at once. So do it as described in the following:

* Install Token Pocket on your main device (phone or tablet)
* Install Dream Card V2 on your second device
* Start the apps on both devices
* In Dream Card V2 select “Wallet Connect” as usual
* Then choose tab “QR Code” instead of “Mobile”

* A QR code to scan should then appear
* In Token Pocket press the button to scan a QR Code and scan it
