Dream Card is inspired by "Pok√©mon Trading Card Game" and combines the technology of blockchain. In the X World Games ecosystem, every NFT card is openly and transparently recorded on the chain and belongs to a specific player. Players can customize their cards to have new attributes and designs, which improves the game's playability.
