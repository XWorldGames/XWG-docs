"Dream Card" was inspired by the famous "Pokémon Trading Card Game". The game combines the classic TCG battle functions and playstyles with crypto blockchain technology, creating a play-to-earn ecosystem. On the X World Games platform, NFT hero cards are transparently recorded on-chain, which means they can be openly bought and sold, and are non-fungible, belonging to a specific player. Players can customize their cards to have new attributes and designs, which improves the game's playability.

Dream Card v1 was successfully launched in June 2021 and attracted more than 1 million+ players globally.
