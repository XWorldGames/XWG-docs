## **Beginner's Guide**

### **Part 1 - Introduction**

#### **1.1 What is Dream Card？**

Dream Card is the first NFT TCG game released by X World Games - the decentralized gaming ecosystem aims to build a blockchain gaming metaverse. The dream cards are blockchain-based on the Binance Smart Chain and can be collected as NFT assets. Dream cards can be customized and grown into new characters with varying degrees of unique designs and compelling images, which lead to powerful combat attributes in the game and high-value collectibles in the market, and players are allowed to trade them freely in the NFT market, thanks to the true digital ownership by blockchain gaming.&#x20;

The game rules are similar to traditional card board games or online TCG card games. Players have to strategically construct a combination deck of cards and defeat with other players by consuming all opponent's cards.

This document can be used as a reference for the standard rules and instruction for novice players. Before starting the game for the first time, please read the content of this page carefully and prepare the tools you need.

#### **1.2 Login**

Dream Card can be played on both PC browsers (such as Chrome or Firefox) and mobile H5 pages. However, if you want to experience the fun of decentralized games fully, it is recommended to have:

Blockchain Wallets - like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io), [Binance Chain Wallet](https://www.binance.com/en/wallet-direct)

The digital wallet is managed as your private account to ensure the safety and security of all your digital assets (such as XWG tokens, NFT cards, virtual props) and recorded progress in the blockchain games.

#### **1.3 Mobile number or email**

If you don't have a blockchain wallet, you can use your mobile phone number or email to register and log in to the game, and your in-game data information will be saved locally. However, when you need to manage your in-game & on-chain assets, you still need to bind them with your digital wallet address.

If this is the first time you have heard of blockchain wallets, we recommend reading the [Getting Blockchain Wallet - Starter Guide](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html).

**If you don't have a card to initiate the game, you have many options:**

#### **Airdrop Event**

The first airdrop event will be announced sometime after the game launch. First-time players can get a "common" rarity card for free during the event. For details of the event, please stay tuned with the official announcement from X World Games.

#### **Mysterious 10 Draw**

After entering the game, players can spend a small amount of XWG tokens to participate in the Mysterious Draw. Players will get ten cards and have a chance to win high-rarity cards.

#### **Mystery Box**

Under the [marketplace](https://nft.xwg.games) page on the [X World Games](https://xwg.games) official website, players can spend XWG tokens to purchase mystery boxes to get one card and have a chance to win high-rarity cards.

#### **NFT Trading market**

Players can sell their unused cards to the [NFT market](https://nft.xwg.games/pages/market/market), and other players can buy them with XWG.



### **Part 2 - Game Attributes**
