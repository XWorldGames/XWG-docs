| Purchase | $XWG is the digital token that players use to purchase in-game items and participate in gaming events.  |
| Mining Pool | Game mining is an approach to enrich the game ecosystem by receiving token rewards from playing games. Token holders could participate in creating new cards and earn a token as a creator from the marketplace. For instance, the X World Games platform would have revenues from card sales, asset sales, transaction fees, etc., and that a fixed proportion would be distributed to the staking pool rewards. NFTs will also have Defi features such as collateralization, repurchase, and burn mechanisms. |
| Governance | Owning XWG tokens enables players to participate in the governance process through a decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\), with development proposals and voting structures. Issues related to the platform operations and development could be voted based on the preference of the token holders. In order to encourage users to participate in the voting process, there will also be rewards for voting actions. |
| Play-to-Earn | There are a proportion of the tokens reserved for user incentives. Players could earn XWG tokens by simply playing games. This design is to encourage user participation in the game, grow the community and maintain platform traction. |
