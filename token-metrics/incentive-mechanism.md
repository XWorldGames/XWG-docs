# Incentive Mechanism

The incentive mechanism of X World Games is divided into the following categories:  


#### Gaming Incentive

A certain percentage of tokens will be reserved for gaming incentives for players. In the game, players can get different amounts of XWG rewards by engaging in various in-game behaviours. This design can encourage users to participate in the game, expand the community and maintain the ecosystem attractiveness.

#### Creation Incentive

X World Games will provide a platform for most game community builders and believers to express themselves. Game developers can create unique game characters, equipment and props on the platform. In the future, a series of open-source game tools will be provided for developers to create independent game projects, enriching the diversified game ecosystem. Developers will receive XWG as an incentive after successful creation.  


#### Liquidity Incentive

X World Games will provide various DeFi decentralized financial functions in the game ecosystem, including liquidity mining, staking mining, DeFi collateral loan and Swap. Players can also receive XWG rewards after successfully providing market liquidity for XWG.  


#### Governance Incentive

XWG token-holders can participate in community and game governance through decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\) actions such as proposal voting to determine issues related to platform operation and game development. To encourage users to participate in more governance processes, X world games will reward participants with XWG tokens after each successful voting.

#### Community Incentive

X World Games will carry out marketing campaigns before or after certain major events, such as new exchange listing or new game launch, in order to raise community awareness and engagement.  Incentive programs like airdrops, bounties, and contests will be announced on the official website or other official channels such as Twitter, Discord, and Medium.
