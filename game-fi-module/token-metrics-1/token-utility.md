| Incentives, Play-to-Earn-to-Stake | The ultimate reward for playing. It comes with the self-developed and pioneered GameFi approach of the Play-to-Earn-to Stake (P2E2S) mechanism. Players could earn XWG tokens by a series of actions from playing and staking. This design encourages user participation in the game, integrates GameFi with DeFi, and resolves the complicated challenge of Gamefi's economic problem.                                     |
| Yield Farming, Stake Mining       | Rewards for DeFi/GameFi, such as liquidity farming & staking, are involved with the practice of staking or lending crypto assets to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional $XWG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Governance                        | Owning XWG tokens enables players to participate in the governance process through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with development proposals and voting structures. Issues related to the platform operations and development could be voted based on the preference of the token holders. In order to encourage users to participate in the voting process, there will also be rewards for voting actions. |
| Purchasing                        | $XWG is the digital token circulated around the X World Games ecosystem, which players use to purchase NFTs & in-game items and participate in different gaming events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
