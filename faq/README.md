<summary>Do we have 3rd party guardian in place to assure the funding?</summary>

There's no third party to assure fund safety in blockchain; however, the blockchain network provides security through cryptography encryption and distributed ledger.&#x20;

The token assets $XWG and Dream Card NFTs issued from X World Games are grounded by BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network, an EVM-compatible blockchain created by Binance, which is designed for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dapps) and run smart contracts. **The BSC network and the algorithm it operates on are indeed very safe**.&#x20;

For more information, please review the article "[Security First in BSC & DeFi: Is Binance Smart Chain Safe?](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/is-binance-smart-chain-safe/)" provided by Binance Acadamy.

Besides the blockchain network, smart contracts programmed by X World Games were also audited by Certik. The detailed report can be found here: [Audit Report](https://docs.xwg.games/docs/audit-report).
