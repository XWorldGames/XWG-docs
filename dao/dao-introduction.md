# Governance

### What is the X World DAO?

A true decentralized ownership of a gaming world via DAO.  Gamers that hold XWG tokens get to decide the platform governance policy or the next in-game development, including reward mechanisms and tokenomic systems.

The ultimate goal for X World Games is to become a truly user-owned game platform with its own Decentralized organization called Community Council governed by the community. So, we integrated a concept of DAO, which over time can take over the majority of new charactersâ€™ powers within the game.
