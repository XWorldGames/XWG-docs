# ðŸ“œRoadmap

X World Games will be completing a gigantic platform infrastructure plan for the product, including gaming hub, NFT exchange, cross-game protocol port, and a full-function game-creation toolbox. Meanwhile, X World Games will be enriching the gaming ecosystem and community by publishing more games and signing more Authentic anime IPs, and connecting migrated games with pre-established tokenomic systems, and guiding the player community to a full DAO governance.
