The portion will be allocated as incentives for project founders, employees, and advisors. There will be a graded vesting period for 36 months with a six-month lock-up period, starting from the initiation of circulation. An additional 18-months cliff vesting period will be applied, which means that only members who have stayed with the project for more than 18 months can receive this incentive.

In addition, X World Games will initiate repurchasing/burning and other re-offering systems through decentralized governance to achieve a better economic deflation and ecological incentive mechanism. The detailed operation will begin with the community proposal and voting, and the whole process will be open and transparent.
