| Governance                          | Owning XWG tokens enables players to participate in the governance process through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with development proposals and voting structures. Issues related to the platform operations and development could be voted based on the preference of the token holders. In order to encourage users to participate in the voting process, there will also be rewards for voting actions.      |
