| Incentives, Play-to-Earn    | Rewards for gaming, or as known as Play-to-Earn. Players could earn XWG tokens by simply playing games. This design is to encourage user participation in the game, grow the community and maintain platform traction.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Yield Farming, Stake Mining | Rewards for DeFi/GameFi, such as liquidity farming & staking, are involved with the practice of staking or lending crypto assets to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional $XWG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Governance                  | Owning XWG tokens enables players to participate in the governance process through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with development proposals and voting structures. Issues related to the platform operations and development could be voted based on the preference of the token holders. In order to encourage users to participate in the voting process, there will also be rewards for voting actions. |
| Purchasing                  | $XWG is the digital token circulated around the X World Games ecosystem, which players use to purchase NFTs & in-game items and participate in different gaming events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
