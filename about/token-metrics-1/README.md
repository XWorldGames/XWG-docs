| <h4>Mining Pool</h4>    | <h4>49%</h4> | This portion will be reserved an incentive for daily game mining. X World Games has designed an inflationary token release mechanism for in-game mining, in which the amount of release will be doubled every year and complete release in 10 years.                                                                                                                                                          |

| <h4>Seed Sale</h4>      | <h4>8%</h4>  | <p>This portion will be held by the project early financers, including seed/strategic sale rounds. No public offering was made. There are different lock-up timeframes for different financing rounds. For the seed sale, starting from the initiation of circulation, the lock-up period is 6 months and gradually released within 12 months. </p><h4></h4>                                                  |
| <h4>Strategic Sale</h4> | <h4>17%</h4> | <p>This portion will be held by the project early financers, including seed/strategic sale rounds. No public offering was made.

| <h4>Team</h4>           | <h4>9%</h4>  | The portion will be allocated as incentives for project founders, employees, and advisors. There will be a graded vesting period for 36 months with a six-month lock-up period, starting from the initiation of circulation. An additional 18-months cliff vesting period will be applied, which means that only members who have stayed with the project for more than 18 months can receive this incentive. |
| <h4>Foundation</h4>     | <h4>9%</h4>  | This portion will be reserved for Foundation’s operations, including auditing, consulting, branding, researching, legal and overhead costs. Tokens will be fully locked at the project initiation phase,  and only a certain portion can be released on an as-needed basis by the future announcement.                                                                                                        |

In addition, X World Games will initiate repurchasing/burning and other re-offering systems through decentralized governance to achieve a better economic deflation and ecological incentive mechanism. The detailed operation will begin with the community proposal and voting, and the whole process will be open and transparent.
