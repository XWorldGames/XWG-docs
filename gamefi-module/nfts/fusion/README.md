# ðŸ§© Fusion

With the Dream Card Fusion system, X World Games players can combine the Dream Card Hero SHARDs they have obtained to create Dream Cards.

Here is how the mechanic will work:

1. Fusion can only occur using SHARDs of the **same hero and rarity.**
2. After Fusion, one of the five Dream Card elements will be randomly assigned.
3. Fusion is **NOT** guaranteed to reward players with a Dream Card. There is a chance that fusing SHARDs will fail.
4. 10,000 LUCID Basic and a small BNB gas fee are needed for each Dream Card Fusion, regardless of rarity.
