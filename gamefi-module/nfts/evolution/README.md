# üîÅ Evolution

With the Dream Card Evolution system, X World Games players will be able to evolve their Dream Cards to a higher quality by sacrificing a base amount of lower quality cards.

### Here is how the mechanic will work:

NFT cards used in Evolution must have the same rarity; Dream Cards of different rarities can not be used.

**If the cards used in Dream Card Evolution have the same name AND quality**, the result will be a Dream Card of the same name but one tier higher in quality (up to Myth).

**If the cards used do not have the same name**, the result will be a random Dream Card but one tier higher in quality (up to Myth).

### How are Stats Determined? <a href="#ebf1" id="ebf1"></a>

The attributes(ATK, HP, Element, Skills) of the cards will depend on the **names** used in Dream Card Evolution.

**If the names of the cards are the same**, then the resulting card will be the same element as the originals. HP & ATK will increase one tier higher in quality. Skills will be randomized according to the resulting quality.

**If the names of the cards are NOT the same**, then all attributes will be randomized on the resulting card (according to the name of the Evolved card)

### **How Will Evolution Affect my Card‚Äôs Powerlevel (Hash Rate)?** <a href="#ecd1" id="ecd1"></a>

If any of the cards used in Dream Card Evolution have an upgraded hash rate, then all additional hash rates will be added to the Evolved card.
