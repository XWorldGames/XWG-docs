**LUCID chests** are a new **BEP-1155** asset that will allow players to collect Dream Card **SHARD**s to craft their favourite Dream Cards heroes.

LUCID chests can be purchased on the [<mark style="color:purple;">**X Marketplace**</mark> ](https://app.xwg.games/#/)or be acquired during our Dream Card special events. Not all Dream Card heroes will be available as Hero SHARDs so be sure to keep an eye out for who is and isn‚Äôt available in each LUCID chest.

****\
**Mechanics:** Opening LUCID chests will require $XWG, LUCID Basic, and a small BNB gas fee.

**Quality:** LUCID chests will be available in Basic, Magic and Super rarities. You can get better rewards and SHARDs with a higher rarity chest.&#x20;

**Chest items:** Hero SHARDs, LUCID Super, LUCID Magic, and Lottery Tickets



Reward quality will depend on the chest's rarity, with **higher rarity chests having higher quality rewards**. Opening a LUCID chest will require $XWG tokens, LUCID Basic, and a BNB gas fee. Different quality chests will have different opening fees.

> In an effort to support the Dream Card game economy, the LUCID Basic and $XWG tokens used in these openings will be regularly collected and burned!\
